It is a story that has a scary beginning;funny in the middle;but a sad ending.
 In the past, There was one ghost called jimmy, he broke a wind in front of
people, and he died.
 After he died the people put up a statue in memory of Jimmy. The statue was
able to also break wind. Some people were upset that it could though.
 Those who were upset by the statue, decided to vandalize it.
This act was very unpopular among the populous.
