It is a story that has a scary beginning;funny in the middle;but a sad ending.
 In the past, There was one ghost called jimmy, he broke a wind in front of
people, and he died.
 After he died the people put up a statue in memory of Jimmy. The statue was
able to also break wind. Some people were upset that it could though.
